# Node.js Nandbox Bot API
[![MIT License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/AmirAlahmedy/nandboxbotsapi/blob/master/LICENSE)

Node.js library to interact with official Nandbox Bot API. A bot token is **required** and can be obtained [this way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXb6tjOuxSc).

## Install
To download the library, just run the following command.
```bash
$ npm i nandbox-bot-api
```

## Build your first bot
You can easily build your bot by following the below steps:

**1.Setup your configuration object** once you get your bot configuration data from nandbox app , copy it to a `config` object.

If you don't know how to get bot configuration data and token from nandbox 

- Open your bot in nandbox app then open  top right menu and click to `Get token` .This process explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXb6tjOuxSc&feature=youtu.be).


You will get data like this:
``` 
token:90091783784280234234WBBPmJAnSD5ILIkc6N6QjY3ZzeY
url:wss://<SERVER>:<PORT>/nandbox/api/  
download:https://<SERVER>:<PORT>/nandbox/download/  
upload:https://<SERVER>:<PORT>/nandbox/upload/
```
Add your token and the other data to  `config.json` file just like below :
```json
{
    "Token": "<your token>",
    "URI": "wss://<SERVER>:<PORT>/nandbox/api/",
    "DownloadServer": "https://<SERVER>:<PORT>/nandbox/download/",  
    "UploadServer": "https://<SERVER>:<PORT>/nandbox/upload/"
}
```

**2.Implement your main.js file :** To do that please follow the next instructions:
1. Make sure `config.json` file is created.
2. Implement the `nCallBack.onConnect` function.
3. Implement the rest of the functions as your application requires.

You will find the below code snippet already written in the `main.js`, implement the necessary functions.
```js
"use strict";
const NandBox = require("nandbox-bot-api/src/NandBox");
const Nand = require("nandbox-bot-api/src/NandBoxClient");
const NandBoxClient = Nand.NandBoxClient;

const config = require("./config.json");


var client = NandBoxClient.get(config);
var nandbox = new NandBox();
var nCallBack = nandbox.Callback;
var api = null;

nCallBack.onConnect = (_api) => {
    // it will go here if the bot connected to the server successfuly 
    api = _api;
    console.log("Authenticated");
}



nCallBack.onReceive = incomingMsg => {
    console.log("Message Received");

    if (incomingMsg.isTextMsg()) {
        let chatId = incomingMsg.chat.id; // get your chat Id
        let text = incomingMsg.text; // get your text message
        api.sendText(chatId, text); // Sending message back as an Echo
    }

}

// implement other nandbox.Callback() as per your bot need
nCallBack.onReceiveObj = obj => console.log("received object: ", obj);
nCallBack.onClose = () => console.log("ONCLOSE");
nCallBack.onError = () => console.log("ONERROR");
nCallBack.onChatMenuCallBack = chatMenuCallback => { }
nCallBack.onInlineMessageCallback = inlineMsgCallback => { }
nCallBack.onMessagAckCallback = msgAck => { }
nCallBack.onUserJoinedBot = user => { }
nCallBack.onChatMember = chatMember => { }
nCallBack.onChatAdministrators = chatAdministrators => { }
nCallBack.userStartedBot = user => { }
nCallBack.onMyProfile = user => { }
nCallBack.onUserDetails = user => { }
nCallBack.userStoppedBot = user => { }
nCallBack.userLeftBot = user => { }
nCallBack.permanentUrl = permenantUrl => { }
nCallBack.onChatDetails = chat => { }
nCallBack.onInlineSearh = inlineSearch => { }

client.connect(config.Token, nCallBack);
```
